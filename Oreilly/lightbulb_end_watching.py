# In the third mission from the series about lightbulbs, I want to separately highlight the process and the period of observation of this process.
# 
# In the previous mission, the start_watching parameter was introduced, and in this one - the end_watching parameter, which tells the time when it’s necessary to end the observation. If it’s not passed, the mission works as in the previous version, with no observation time limit.
# 
# One more update is that the amount of elements (button clicks) can be odd (previously there was a precondition, that the amount of elements is always even).
# 
# Input:Three arguments and only the first one is required. The first one is a list of datetime objects, the second and the third ones are the datetime objects.
# 
# Output:A number of seconds as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:
# 
# The array of pressing the button is always sorted in ascending order.The array of pressing the button has no repeated elements.The minimum possible date is 1970-01-01The maximum possible date is 9999-12-31
